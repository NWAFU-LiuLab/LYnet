In order to examine the efficacy of the proposed model, an independent dataset (named TTCA-IND) was constructed by randomly selecting 20% from the benchmark dataset while treating the remaining samples as the training dataset (named TTCA-CV). Finally, the TTCA-CV dataset consisted of 470 positive and 318 negative samples while the TTCA-IND dataset consisted of 122 positive and 75 negative samples
